# Ethical AI Tooling

This repo serves to experiment with tooling for making AI more trustworthy,
i.e., more transparent, fair, secure and privacy-respecting. My aim is to 
work with real-world datasets as much as possible in order to ensure
transferability to practice.

## Setup

### Environment

Run the `install.sh` script in order to setup a _conda_ environment containing
the necessary packages. Alternatively, you can run the outlined steps manually.

### Data

Complete the following steps in order to run the notebooks:
- Download the HELOC dataset from the [FICO Explainable ML Challenge page](https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge?tabset-3158a=2)
- Put the downloaded CSV file into a newly created directory `data/heloc`
